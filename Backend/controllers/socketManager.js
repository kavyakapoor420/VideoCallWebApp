// Summary
//This function sets up a real-time WebSocket server using socket.io that allows clients to:

//Join a "call" (room) and broadcast that to other connected clients.
//Send chat messages to other users in the same room.
//Exchange signaling messages (typically used in WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication).
//Disconnect and notify other users of their departure, cleaning up rooms as needed.
//It handles connections, room management, message broadcasting, and disconnections while tracking the users' online time.


//The code sets up a Socket.io server to handle real-time communication for 
// a system with multiple "calls" (rooms).
//It handles events like joining a call (join-call), sending signals 
// for peer-to-peer communication (signal), sending chat messages (chat-message), and handling disconnections (disconnect).
//It tracks users in each room and maintains the message history 
// for each room. When a user joins, they are sent any previous messages in the room, and when a user disconnects, others in the room are notified.
